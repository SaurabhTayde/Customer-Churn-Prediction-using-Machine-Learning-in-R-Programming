# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-in-R-Programming
In this repository, telecom churn analysis is covered and here a complete EDA process is performed to determine if the customer from that particular telecom industry will leave that telecom service or not. Also, we build a model to predict how likely a customer will churn by analyzing its characteristics: (1) demographic information, (2) account information, and (3) services information. The objective is to obtain a data-driven solution that will allow us to reduce churn rates and, as a consequence, to increase customer satisfaction and corporation revenue.
